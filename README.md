# Graf-Python
# General info

## Main goals
Algorithms that have been implemented to:

-Search through the graph
-Searching the graph deep
-Making a school path
-Shortest paths with bank (Dijkstra's algorithm)
-Coloring graphs using the greedy algorithm algorithm
-Euler cycle
-The Hamilton cycle
Graphs resemble the graphical way in which a matrix figure is represented
a neighborhood matrix or an incident matrix, and also as a neighborhood list.

# Technologies
The project was made in Python on the Pycharm environment
